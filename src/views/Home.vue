    | #[b Note:] KomuTracker on Android is in a very early stage of development. There will be bugs, but we hope you bear with us as we refine things and get it on par with the desktop version of KomuTracker (which you should try!).

  h3 Hello early user,
  p
    | It's still early days for KomuTracker #[span(v-if="$isAndroid") (especially on Android!)]. We've come a long way but we need users (like you!)
    | to provide feedback and help us turn KomuTracker into a successful project.
    | Early users like you mean a lot to us, and we hope you'll reach out to us with any ideas you have for improvements!
  p
    | If you are a developer, we hope you can contribute by writing a watcher, visualization, or something else, and share it with us on the forum!
  p
